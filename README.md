# Portfolio Website

This website was created in my free-time as a way to have an easily accessible resume, as well as show off some of my skills of HTML / CSS & SCSS / JavaScript.

# Production Ready

The SCSS needs to be compiled into CSS prior to pushing (minified is preferred)

```sh
sass styles.scss --style compressed
```
