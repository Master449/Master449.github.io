        <h1>Hello there.</h1>
        <p class="st">My name is David Flowers II.</p>
        <p class="st">Currently wrapping up my Bachelors in Computer Science.</p>
        <h2>Personal History</h2>
        <p class="content">I have always been fueled by a lifelong love of computers and how they operate. Ever since
            I was 6 years old playing Toontown on my Moms Dell Dimension 2400. Despite the many viruses and headaches I
            would come by, I always pushed forward learning and exploring what they had to offer. I specced out my first
            machine when I was 13, started dailying various Linux distributions when I was 16, and currently have a 42U
            server rack operating in my basement.</p>
        <h2>Why does this resume website look like this?</h2>
        <p class="content">I know a lot about website design but I wanted this website to be fast, and as minimal
            as possible. I wanted to replicate parts of the internet that I remember growing up. The site currently
            weighs in at <i id="size">47.3 Kb.</i> This website can fit <i id="iphone">100x</i> times in an iPhone 15
            HEIF photo. I also wanted no ads, analytics, tracking, and finger printing. And any JavaScript
            is super minimal. This was also a project to test how lean I can make any assets this site needs. Adding
                onto that, the entire website is loaded currently. The navbar up there are CSS tabs, not links. If you're curious about more of the stats, you can check them out <button onclick="showtab('stats')">here</button></p>

                        <p>A Group Project for CSCI 467: Software Engineering. For this project we we're given a purpose;
                            Ours
                            being an Online Auto Parts Store. This project had a few constraints, like a legacy database
                            that
                            was read only, to a remote Credit Card Authorization System. Other than that we had total
                            freedom.
